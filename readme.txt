    The dashboard displays all queue requests with details including queue ID, patient ID, severity, wait time, and status.
    For each queue request with status "waiting", there is a button to admit the patient.
    Clicking the "Admit" button changes the queue status to "completed" and reduces the wait times of all other waiting patients by 5 minutes.
